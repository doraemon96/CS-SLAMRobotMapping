EXERCISE 1: Bayes Filter and EKF

(a) Describe briefly the two main steps of the Bayes filter in your 
own words.

The two fundamental steps that the Bayes filter performs are the 
prediction step and the correction step.
The prediction steps consists in calculating the probabilites of
finding the robot in a particular position with a particular
orientation, given the last prediction's uncertainty.
The correction steps uses the sensor's results to attempt to find
a correlation between them and the predicted state of the world.


(b) Describe briefly the meaning of the following probability
density functions: P(Xt | Ut, Xt-1), P(Zt | Xt) and bel(Xt), which
are processed by the Bayes Filter.

The first density function results in a current state estimate given
the previous state and the action taken by the actor.
The second function predicts how the state of the world should be
given the current state of the world.
Finally bel is the belief that the world is found in a particular
state, calculated by taking in account the predicted most probable
current state (first equation) and the sensed data.

(c) Specify the (normal) distributions that correspond to the above
mentioned three terms in EFK SLAM.

For EKF SLAM, we use the functions g and h to replace the linear 
functions that model the predicted changes in the world by:

Xt = g(Ut, Xt-1) + Et ; Zt = h(Xt) + Dt

P(Xt | Ut, Xt-1) is approximated by the Normal distribution, centered
in ???, with a deviation equal to ???.

P(Zt | Xt) ???

bel(Xt) ???
