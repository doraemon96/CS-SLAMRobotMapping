HYPOTHESIS:

We know the probability of success on painting a blank object:
p(x_t+1 = colored | x_t = blank , u_t+1 = paint) = 0.9
#p(x_t+1 = blank | x_t = blank , u_t+1 = paint) = 0.1

And the probability that the sensor is wrong/right given
that is shows the object as colored:
p(z = colored | x = blank) = 0.2
p(z = colored | x = colored) = 0.7
# p(z = blank | x = blank) = 0.8
# p(z = blank | x = colored) = 0.3


UNKNOWN:
We have no idea of the previous state of the object,
we know it was meant to be painted and the sensor
indicates it has.

What is the probability of it having failed?
P(Xt = blank | Ut = paint, Zt = colored)

BAYES FILTER:

This is based on an uniform prior distribution (or prior assumption),
chosen because of the lack of information about the state of the
world.

As of now, uniformity means that 
    bel(X0=blank) = bel(X0 = colored) = 0.5


bel'(X1 = blank)
    = sum{X0}( P(X1 = blank | U1 = paint, X0) * bel(X0) )
    = P(X1 = blank | U1 = paint, X0 = blank) * bel(X0 = blank)
      + P(X1 = blank | U1 = paint, X0 = colored) * bel(X0 = colored)
    = 0.1 * 0.5 + 0 * 0.5 = 0.05

Here we supposed that once colored it can't be un-colored.

bel(X1 = blank)
    = nu * P(Z1 = colored | X1 = blank) * bel'(X1 = blank)
    = nu * 0.2 * 0.05
    = nu * 0.01

Now, to calculate nu, we have to know the bel(X1 = colored)

bel'(X1 = blank) 
    = P(X1 = colored | U1 = paint , X0 = blank) * bel(X0 = blank)
      + P(X1 = colored | U1 = paint, X0 = colored) * bel(X0 = colored)
    = 0.9 * 0.5 + 1 * 0.5 = 0.95

bel(X1 = colored)
    = nu * P(Z1 = colored | X1 = colored) * bel'(X1 = colored)
    = nu * 0.7 * 0.95
    = nu * 0.665

Then nu = 1/(0.01 + 0.665) = 1/0.675 = 1.481481

At last we have our result:

bel(X1 = blank) = 1.481 * 0.01 = 0.014814
